# Dependencies
#### Linux System

#### C++ Compiler
  Any C++ compiler that supports C++14 standard or higher. To use MKL, install Intel oneAPI toolkit.

#### CUDA Toolkit
  https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit   
  Required for the GPU computation. If it is not installed, ask admin for its installation.

#### Anaconda
  https://www.anaconda.com/

* * *
Environment variables must be set so that `nvcc` and `conda` can be executed in the command line (Type `which nvcc` and `which conda` to check the installation).

# Compiling
```Shell
conda create -n test python=3.9 cmake=3.19 conda git \
pybind11 scipy openmpi  
conda activate lfts  
git clone https://github.com/yongdd/langevin-fts.git  
cd langevin-fts && mkdir build && cd build  
cmake ../   
make -j8  
make test   
make install   
```
* If you want to use FFTW library, clone from `fftw` branch. That is distributed under GPL license.  
```Shell
git clone -b fftw https://github.com/yongdd/langevin-fts.git  
```
* **If you encounter `segmentation fault`, type following commands.**     
```Shell
ulimit -s unlimited  
export OMP_STACKSIZE=1G  
```
*  If you want to remove all installations :cry:, type following commands.   
```Shell
conda deactivate  
conda env remove -n lfts  
```
# User Guide
+ This is not an application but a library for SCFT and L-FTS, and you need to write your own program using Python language. It requires a little programming, but this approach provides flexibility and you can easily customize your applications.   
+ **A few basic SCFT and L-FTS scripts are provided in `examples` folder. Please start from those scripts: scft/Gyroid.py, fts/DiscreteGyroid.py, fts/ContinuousLamellar.py.**   
+ If your ultimate goal is to use deep learning boosted L-FTS, you may use the sample scripts of DL-FTS repository. (One can easily turn on/off deep learning from the scripts.)  
+ To use this library, first activate virtual environment by typing `conda activate lfts` in command line. In Python script, import the package by adding  `from langevinfts import *`.   
+ Be aware that the unit of length in this library is the end-to-end chain length *aN^(1/2)*, not the gyration of radius *a(N/6)^(1/2)*, where *a* is statistical segment length and *N* is polymerziation index.  
+ The fields acting on chain are described using `per chain` language instead of `per segment` language for both SCFT and L-FTS. The same notation is used in [*Macromolecules* **2013**, 46, 8037]. If you want to obtain the same fields used in [*Polymers* **2021**, 13, 2437], multiply *1/N* to each field.
+ Use FTS in 1D and 2D only for the test. It does not have a physical meaning.
+ Open-source has no warranty. Make sure that this program reproduces the results of previous FTS studies, and also produces resonable results.  
+ Matlab and Python tools for visualization and renormalization are included in `tools` folder.   

# Developer Guide
#### Platforms  
  This program is designed to run on different platforms such as MKL and CUDA, and there is a family of classes for each platform. To produce instances of these classes for given platform, `abstract factory pattern` is adopted.   

#### Anderson Mixing  
  It is neccesery to store recent history of fields during iteration. For this purpose, it is natural to use `circular buffer` to reduce the number of array copys. If you do not want to use such data structure, please follow the code in [*Polymers* **2021**, 13, 2437]. There will be a performance loss of 5~10%.

#### Python Binding  
  `pybind11` is utilized to generate Python interfaces for the C++ classes.
